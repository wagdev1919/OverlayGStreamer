Configure GStreamer pipeline for recording video from camera to the local HD and streaming to RTMP server, and also show a preiview with image overlay.
My Gstreamer pipeline's been configured to do three things simultaniously.
### 1.Recording Video from camera ###
### 2.Streaming The Video to RTMP server ###
### 3.Preview with image overlay ###
